# blockmatrix

A python package to provide easier working with block-structured matrices. Currently, this
code mostly serves my purposes, i.e., manipulating block-structured covariance matrices
and applying high-dimensional estimation techniques to them.

## Usage

As of now unfortunately only the code and the docstrings are available as documentation.

Running the `examples/main_spatiotemporal_manipulations.py` showcases some of the
functionality and visualizations.

## Todos

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Implementation of sklearn style covariance estimators
- [ ] Abstract mne channels away
